# Collaborative Drawing Canvas

This project is a collaborative drawing canvas built using **Socket.io**, **Next.js**, **Zustand**, and a custom drawing tool. It enables multiple users to draw on the same canvas in real-time, making it ideal for collaborative work, design, or fun interactive activities.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can draw simultaneously on the same canvas.
- **Custom Drawing Tool**: Allows users to draw freehand or with predefined tools (e.g., pens, lines, shapes).
- **Live Updates**: The canvas updates instantly as other users draw, with minimal latency.
- **Zustand State Management**: Zustand manages the app's state, ensuring smooth updates between the client and server.
- **Next.js for SSR**: Server-side rendering with Next.js ensures optimal performance and SEO benefits.

## Technologies

- **Socket.io**: Facilitates real-time communication between the client and the server.
- **Next.js**: React framework for building the user interface and handling server-side logic.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management tool for React.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for drawing and rendering graphics on the web page.
